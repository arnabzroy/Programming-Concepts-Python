# Longest common subsequence
# Input   :- A[1..M],B[1..N] Output  :- C[1..P]
# Subsequence of A and B
# X is a subsequence of Y if X is obtained by dropping elements of Y
# "ad" is a subsequence of "abcde"
# A="abcde" and B="bceadq"  => "bcd" and "ad" are common sequences
# LCS of A and B is "bcd" and "bce"
