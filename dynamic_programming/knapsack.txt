Knapsack 0/1
- Either take it or leave it

wt = [1,3,5,7]
val = [1,4,5,7]
W=7 is the max weight the knaspsack can hold
j => 1 to W values
i => wt[] given along with their values.

if j < i: # Here the target weight is lesser than the available weight, hence we cannot take the available weight
    T[i][j] = T[i-1][j]
else:
    T[i][j] = max(val[i] + T[i-1][j-wt[i]), T[i-1][j])
    
Here val[i] + T[i-1][j-wt[i]] => We are selecting wt[i] i.e. val[i], hence remaining weight is j-wt[i] which is the jth col
                                 Hence for remaining weight we select T[i-1][j-wt[i]
