- Two matrix can be multiplied if rows of one and column of others are same i.e. p*q and q*r
- Number of scalar operations to multiply are p*q*r
- Size of resulting matrix is p*r (rows and columns)
- Order in which we multiply multiple matrices can optimize the number of scalar operations required
- Number of ways to do matrix multiplication is (2*(n-1))!/((n)!*(n-1)!)
eg:- n=4
    (2 * 3)! /((4!) * 3!)= 6 * 5 / 6 = 5
    
    n=3 => 2 ways
    n=4 => 5 ways
    n=5 => 14 ways
