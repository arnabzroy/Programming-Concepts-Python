How to send packets from a host to another?
==========================================
Unicast => one to one host
broadcast => one to many hosts

CA => 1- 126
CB => 128 - 191
SS => 192-223

eg:-

NW1 - 11.0.0.0 (always first ip is reserved for n/w ip i.e. 0.0.0)
NW2 - 22.0.0.0 (always first ip is reserved for n/w ip i.e. 0.0.0)
Both are class A
Packet => | Data | Source Addr | Destination Addr |

Unicast
=======
Limited or direct boradcasting

In Limited 
Packet => | Data | Source Addr | Destination Addr | i.e. Packet => | XYZ | 11.2.1.3 | 255.255.255.255| (send to all)
Can be used in the same network

In direct boradcasting
Packet => | Data | Source Addr | Destination Addr | i.e. Packet => | XYZ | 11.2.1.3 | 22.255.255.255| (send to all in network "22")

CA => 1- 126
CB => 128 - 191
SS => 192-223

eg:-
IP - 1.2.3.4
NID => 1.0.0.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 1.255.255.255
This is class A

eg:-
IP - 10.15.20.60
NID => 10.0.0.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 10.255.255.255
This is class A


eg:-
IP - 130.1.2.3
NID => 130.1.0.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 130.1.255.255
This is class B

eg:-
IP - 150.0.150.150
NID => 150.0.0.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 150.0.255.255
This is class B

eg:-
IP - 200.1.10.100
NID => 200.1.10.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 200.1.10.255
This is class C

eg:-
IP - 220.15.1.0
NID => 220.15.1.0
LBA => 255.255.255.255
DBA => 220.15.1.255
This is class C

eg:-
IP - 250.0.1.2
NID => N/A
LBA => N/A
DBA => N/A
This is class E

eg:-
IP - 300.1.2.3
This is invalid since first octate cannot be greater than 255
