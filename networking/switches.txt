Imporvement over Hub which is nothing but a splitter, which does a broadcast of all data on all ports.
- COmmunication between devices on the same network
- Layer 2
- Use MAC(MAC's are unique for each device with upper digits indicating the manufacturer) for unique identification of devices on the network
- SMart to recognize the destination by remebering the port it is connected to
- Better than Hub
- Managed/Umanaged switches

Speed
------
- 10/100/1000 on a switch indicates it supports 10 or 100 or 1000 Mb/s
- Un-managed switches will auto detect the speed and set the corresponding speed to the ports, managed switches cn hard code the speed
- Backplane bandwidth is important to drive switches

Trunk
------
- Trunk ports helps connect multiple switches together
- Fiber for Cisco switches which can handle 10GB/s

VLANs (only for managed switch)
-----
- Segragating devices intro different areas i.e. separate ports into different virtual LANs
- VLANs cannot talk between each other, we need routers to talk between VLANs

Power over ethernet
-------------------
Ability to power ON/OFF devices like computer, VOIP, phone etc.
Power per port or power for entire switch
Convergence => VOIP, survellience etc connected to same network

QOS
----
Priortizing the services eg:- VOIP is on the top, survellience is below and so on..


Routing protocols
------------------ 
Switches talk between each other using the routing protocols like spanning tree protocol, 

eg:- Let's say 6 switches are connected through a Trunk, the spanning tree protocol enables the communication
