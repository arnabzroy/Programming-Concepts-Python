Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
10.0.0.0        *               255.255.255.0   U     1      0        0 eth0

default         RTA1025W.home   0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 eth0

First entry tell you the following:
-----------------------------------
Any traffic with destination 10.0.0.0 will not be using a gateway (thats the * on the line), 
will be using a 255.255.255.0 net mask, route is UP (that's the meaning of the U) and which interface the route uses.
If you do ifconfig -a you will probably see that your eth0 IP address is within the 10.0.0.0 range, 
so this is you local network route.

Third entry tells you the following:
------------------------------------
If any traffic does not fit the traffic defined on any other rules then use this route.
Imagine you want to visit www.yahoo.com. The address will be translated (I don't know what the exact result,
but it won't be in the 10.0.0.0 range for sure). Since it won't fit on the 1st or the 2nd route,
it will be routed using the RTA1025W.home gateway. 
The metric will not matter and it will be using the interface defined on the default route line.
