- InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder
- When to pass parameters, return value
- When to do pre-order/post-order, in-order processing
- When to short circuit and return (eg:- is_balanced.py)
- Tail recursion i.e. accumulate (eg:- getMax.py)

Iterative InOrder, PreOrder, PostOrder
--------------------------------------
curr => top of stack
prev => Last pushed element if going from top to bottom
        Last poped element if going from bottom to top

 1. Going from top to bottom root to left
   prev.left == curr
   prev.right == curr
   
2. Going from bottom to top 
   curr.left == prev
   curr.right == prev
