- Why do u need them?
BST's can be unbalanced which increases search time, so  keeping BST's balanced helps search become O(logN) on an average

- How do splay trees work?
1. They are nearly balance BST's(not exactly balanced)
2. All operations involve something called "splay"
3. On an average takes O(logN)
4. Worst case O(N)
5. For K play operations with K reasonably large O(K * logn)
6. Provides faster access to recently accessed keys(like a cache)
