Complete Binary tree
-----------------------
Complete binary tree is one in which each level exacept possibly he last level is completely filled
and nodes are as far left as possible.

Full Binary tree
------------------
Each node is either the leaf node or possesses exactly two children.

Heap is a complete binary tree(all nodes available except the lowest level nodes)
Parent => p Left => 2p Right => 2p + 1
Parent always at floor of p/2
In a heap, for every node x with parent p, the key in p is smaller than or equal to the key in x

Entire binary heap can be represented by a single list since it is a complete binary tree

Why do we need heaps?
---------------------
In a list, inserting O(N) and sorting is O(N log N)
We need these functions to implement a priority queue
Heap can do both of these in O(log N)


Add to Heap
----------
- Add to leaf, and swim to top the value by comparison wih parent.

Remove Min/Max i.e. Top from Heap
----------
- Remove Root
- Add some leaf node to root and then sink by comparison with children

Heaps can be represented with arrays
------------------------------------
for every parent "p" the children are at "2p + 1" and "2p + 2"
and for each child "c" parent is at n-1/2 floor

Maximum height for complete binary tree
-----------------------------------------
max(nodes) = 2 ^(h+1)-1
h           1   2  3  4      
max_node    3   7 15  31

How to build Max-Heap/Min-Heap
------------------------------
Simplest way => Sort O(N logN)
Can we do better?

Leaves are always => floor(n/2) + 1 to n
Properties
----------
1. Every leaf always follows max-heap property
2. From largest index not a leaf apply heapify(parent and it's children) and make sure parent is greater than or equal to it's children
