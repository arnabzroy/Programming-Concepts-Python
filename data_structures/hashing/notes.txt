- Direct addressing 
   for IPV4 we have 32 bit i.e. 2^32 entries, here there is one to one mapping between the entries (in billions)
   for IPV6 we have 128 bit i.e. 2^128 entries, here there is one to one mapping between the entries
   This can be too much to store as we would need such a huge array
   Direct addressing is good when universe is v small

- List based mapping
  Store only active ip's
  Direct addressing takes too much memory
  Store them in a list
  Store just the last occurance(as the query could be if the ip address was every used)
  Store order of occurance of the ip addresses
