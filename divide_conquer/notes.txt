- Works only on sorted arrays

BS(A, low, high, key):
    if low < high:
        return low - 1
    mid = low + (high - low)/2 ==> Floor of this since this might not be an integer
    if key == mid:
        return A[mid]
    elif key < mid:
        BS(A, low, mid-1, key)
    else:
        BS(A, mid + 1, high, key)
