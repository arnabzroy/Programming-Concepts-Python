Divide and Conquer principles
------------------------------
- Divide problem in non-overlapping sub-problems
- Sub-problems are similar and cannot be dis-similar
- One could recursively or iteratively solve the sub problems
- Once above is done combine the results

Binary Search
---------------
- Works only on sorted arrays
- Recurrance relation :- T(n) = T(n/2) + c
- Base case is for empty array T(n) = c


BS(A, low, high, key):
    if low < high:
        return low - 1
    mid = low + (high - low)/2 ==> Floor of this since this might not be an integer
    if key == mid:
        return A[mid]
    elif key < mid:
        BS(A, low, mid-1, key)
    else:
        BS(A, mid + 1, high, key)
