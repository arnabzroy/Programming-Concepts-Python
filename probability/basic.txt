1. Random experiment
   Tossing a coin
   Rolling a dice
   Picking an object
   
2. Sample space
   Set of possible outcomes of an experiment
   For tossing a coing sample space is {H, T}
   Rolling a dice S ={1,2,3,4,5,6}
   Toss two coins S ={HH, HT, TH, TT}
   Two dice S = {1,1 1,2 1,3 1,4...6,6} i.e. 36

3. Event
   Subset of the sample space eg:- with atleast one head E1 = {HH, HT, TH}
   Union of events or mutually exclusive events

4. S ={H, T}
   E = {H}  E1={T}
   P(E) = 1/2
   P(E1) = 1/2
