What is __main__ ?
====================

In the below:-
=> True Only if caller is the main function itself else ignored
   ./hello.py => In this case __name__ = "main" hence below will be executed
   import hello => In this case __name__ != "main" hence below will not be executed                
 
if __name__ == '__main__':  
  main()

#!/usr/bin/env python

# import modules used here -- sys is a very standard one
import sys

# Gather our code in a main() function
def main():
    print 'Hello there', sys.argv[1]
    # Command line args are in sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2] ...
    # sys.argv[0] is the script name itself and can be ignored

# Standard boilerplate to call the main() function to begin
# the program.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
    
    
How to know help about a module?
