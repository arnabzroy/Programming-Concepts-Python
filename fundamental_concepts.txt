=> What is polynomial and exponential?
  Polynomial is x^y
  Exponential is 2^y
  x is your data size
  Usually(for all known polynomial algorithms) y is maximum 4, Hence 2^y is most of the times greater than x^y
  Np-Hard => No polynomial time algorithm that exists. 
  
=> What is P and NP?
P solved and verified in polynomial time
NP is verifiable but not solvable in polynomial time

=> What is NP Hard
NP problems 


=> what is NP complete?
a decision problem which is both NP and NP hard
