=> What is polynomial and exponential?
  Polynomial is x^y
  Exponential is 2^y
  x is your data size
  Usually(for all known polynomial algorithms) y is maximum 4, Hence 2^y is most of the times greater than x^y
  Np-Hard => No polynomial time algorithm that exists. 
  
=> What is P and NP?
P solved and verified in polynomial time
NP is verifiable but not solvable in polynomial time

Np is a superset and P is a subset of NP

=> What is NP Hard
NP hard need not be even verifiable in polynomial time

=> what is NP complete?
Similar problems with polynomial solution and verification

1> Problems are reducible(problems of similar type)
2> Verify a problem in Polynomial time
3> A problem is solvable in polynomial time

3 = P
2 = NP
1&2 = NP Complete
!2 = NP Hard
