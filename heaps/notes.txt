Heap is a complete binary tree(all nodes available except the lowest level nodes)
Parent => p Left => 2p Right => 2p + 1
Parent always at floor of p/2
In a heap, for every node x with parent p, the key in p is smaller than or equal to the key in x


Why do we need heaps?
---------------------
In a list, inserting O(N) and sorting is O(N log N)
We need these functions to implement a priority queue
Heap can do both of these in O(log N)
