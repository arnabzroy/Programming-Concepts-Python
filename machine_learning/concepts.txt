***Training set => eg:- Different house prices based on size

m => No of training examples
x => Input variables          (house size)     
y => output/target variables  (housing prices)

(x,y) - single training example
x^i, y^i - ith training example


*** Supervised learning
give right answer/output/target for the input variable

*** Regression problem
Predicting the answer/output/target for the input variable

*** Classification problem
Discrete values eg:- 0/1 for tumuors malignant or not.

Training Set => Learning Algorithm => h (Hypothesis)

Size of house =>  h (Hypothesis) => Target price of house
