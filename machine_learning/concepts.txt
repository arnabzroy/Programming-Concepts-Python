***Training set => eg:- Different house prices based on size

m => No of training examples
x => Input variables          (house size)     
y => output/target variables  (housing prices)

(x,y) - single training example
x^i, y^i - ith training example


*** Supervised learning
give right answer/output/target for the input variable

*** Regression problem
Predicting the answer/output/target for the input variable

*** Classification problem
Discrete values eg:- 0/1 for tumuors malignant or not.

Training Set => Learning Algorithm => h (Hypothesis)

*** Linear regression
Size of house =>  h (Hypothesis) => Target price of house
 h => Function which maps  X's to Y's
 
Idea is to predict that y is a linear function of x i.e. 
y = mx + c
h^@(x) = @^0 + @^1*x

|y

|   x
|_ _ _ _ _ 

** Why linear function => this is not necessary, just a starting step.
** This example is called univariate linear regression(linear regression with single variable)
