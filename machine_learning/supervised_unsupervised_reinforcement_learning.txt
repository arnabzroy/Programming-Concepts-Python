Unsupervised learning(description) => Based on self created description
eg:- A bunch of people
One can divide them based on height, weight etc..

Supervised learning(function approximation) => Based on provided inputs on how things look
eg:- A bunch of people
And if someone provides a picture of how an Indian looks, we can categorize people as Indian based on the input data

Reinforcement learning => Make decisions based on continuous feedback from the physical environment.
eg:-
Tic Tac Toe
Avoid mistakes made in the past by avoiding them in the future by learning from the past.
