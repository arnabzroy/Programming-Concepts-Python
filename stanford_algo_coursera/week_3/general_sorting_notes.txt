- Best comparison level sorts can do is O(N logN)
- Comparison sorts are independet of data types or contents
eg:- MergeSort, QuickSort, HeapSort

Non-Comparison Sorts(depend on data type)
eg:- Bucket Sort => Divide data into buckets, given that any number is between a given range, also uniformly random
     Counting Sort => Good for integera and small integers. where K < N, K is number of buckets
     Radix Sort => Extension of counting sort, sorts by decimal LSB to MSB
