- Understanding why average for quicksort is N LogN

Sample space => All possible outcomes

What is discrete probability?
------------------------------
1. In discrete probability outcomes are finite unlike general probability.
2. Probability of each outcome is P(i) >= 0
3. Also sum of all outcomes summation of P(i) is 1

EXAMPLE:- Roll 2 dices
Outcomes:- {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)...(6,6)} => 36 outcomes
P(i) = 1/36 for all i belonging to the sample space

EXAMPLE:- Choose a random pivot in quicksort from (1,2,3,4..n) where each is index of pivot
Hence P(i) is 1/n for all i belonging to the sample space

Events
-------
Events are subset of all possible outcomes in a sample space
Probability of an event is the summation of all possible probabilities for the subset the event belongs to.

EXAMPLE:- Roll 2 dices, probability that sum is 7
5,2 4,3 6,1 2,5 3,4 1,6

EXAMPLE:- In QuickSort, what is the probability that a randomly choosen pivot has a split better than 25-75
Since the atleast need 25% on any side we can use on left side 25-75 and right side can be 75-25 and vice versa, so we can choose 50 different index for pivot to maintain this  which is 50/100 which is 1/2,

Random Variables
-----------------
Given a set of outcomes, this is a function on the outcomes which gives a particular value.
Example:- Sum of two dice, can be two at minium and 12 as maximum.
Example:- Size of subarray passed to QuickSort recursive calls

Expectation
------------
E[X] is the average value of a random variable X i.e. sum of X[i]*P[i]
