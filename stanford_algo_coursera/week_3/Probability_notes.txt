- Understanding why average for quicksort is N LogN

Sample space => All possible outcomes

What is discrete probability?
------------------------------
1. In discrete probability outcomes are finite unlike general probability.
2. Probability of each outcome is P(i) >= 0
3. Also sum of all outcomes summation of P(i) is 1

EXAMPLE:- Roll 2 dices
Outcomes:- {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)...(6,6)} => 36 outcomes
P(i) = 1/36 for all i belonging to the sample space

EXAMPLE:- Choose a random pivot in quicksort from (1,2,3,4..n) where each is index of pivot
Hence P(i) is 1/n for all i belonging to the sample space

Events
-------
Events are subset of all possible outcomes in a sample space
Probability of an event is the summation of all possible probabilities for the subset the event belongs to.

EXAMPLE:- Roll 2 dices, probability that sum is 7
5,2 4,3 6,1 2,5 3,4 1,6

EXAMPLE:- In QuickSort, what is the probability that a randomly choosen pivot has a split better than 25-75
Since the atleast need 25% on any side we can use on left side 25-75 and right side can be 75-25 and vice versa, so we can choose 50 different index for pivot to maintain this  which is 50/100 which is 1/2,

Random Variables
-----------------
Given a set of outcomes, this is a function on the outcomes which gives a particular value.
Example:- Sum of two dice, can be two at minium and 12 as maximum.
Example:- Size of subarray passed to QuickSort recursive calls

Expectation
------------
E[X] is the average value of a random variable X i.e. sum of X[i]*P[i]
Example:- Expectation of sum of two dice
2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12
Average is 7 since we can pair 2,12 3,11 4,10 5,9 6,8 7 and so on..

Example:- Expectation of the size of subarray passed in QuickSort to the first recursive call
Let X be the subarray size
We could have pivot at 0,1,2,3..n indices
E[X] = 1/n*0 + 1/n*1 + 1/n*2 + .. 1/n*(n-1)
     = (n-1)/2
     
Linearity of Expectation
-------------------------



Load Balancing
---------------
Problem:- Assign N processes to N servers

Possible Solution:- Assign each process to a random server
Question:- What is the expect number of processes per server

Entire sample space(all possible outcomes are) => N^N
Let Y be the number of processes which can be assigned to the first server
E[Y] = ?
Indicator random variables have value 1/0 or True/False
Xj => "1" if jth process is assigned to first server else "0"
Hence any server with randomly selected process on an average will have 1 process.

Conditional Probability
------------------------
P(X | Y) => Probability of X given Y is P(X intersection Y)/P(Y)

Fiven two dice, what is the probability that atleast one dice is 1, given sum of two dice is 7
1,6 
X = atleast one is 1
Y = sum of two dice is 7 => 1,6 2,5 4,3 6,1 5,2 3,4 
P(X intersection Y) = {(1,6) (6,1)}/36 = 2/36
P(Y) = 6/36
P(X | Y) = 2/36 / 6/36 = 1/3

Independence of Events
-----------------------
Events are independent if Pr(X intersection Y) = Pr(X). Pr(Y)
Usefulness?
Probability of two independent events is the multiplication of the individual events probabilities
and same with expectation
