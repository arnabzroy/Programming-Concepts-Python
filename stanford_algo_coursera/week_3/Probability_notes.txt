- Understanding why average for quicksort is N LogN

Sample space => All possible outcomes

What is discrete probability?
------------------------------
1. In discrete probability outcomes are finite unlike general probability.
2. Probability of each outcome is P(i) >= 0
3. Also sum of all outcomes summation of P(i) is 1

EXAMPLE:- Roll 2 dices
Outcomes:- {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3)...(6,6)} => 36 outcomes
P(i) = 1/36 for all i belonging to the sample space

EXAMPLE:-Choose a random pivot in quicksort from (1,2,3,4..n) where each is index of pivot
Hence P(i) is 1/n for all i belonging to the sample space
