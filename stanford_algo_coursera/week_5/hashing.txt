Arrays advantages
-------------------
- Random access 
- Retrieval and Storage in O(1)

Purpose
----------
Maintain an possible evolving set of stuff
(people associated data, ip addresses, trnsactions etc..)

Operations
-----------
1. Insert => Add a new record
2. Delete => Remove an existing record
3. Lookup => Retrive/Check an existing record

Guarantees all the above operations in O(1) => Amazing Guarantee!!, this is amortized.
Also this guarantee holds only for properly implemented hash table

De-Duplication
--------------
Given a stream of objects
1. linear scan through a huge file
2. objects arriving in real time

Goal
-----
Remove duplicates (keep track of unique objects)
eg:- Report unique visitors to websites, avoid duplicate results in search etc.

Solution
--------
Use hash tables, if a new object X arrives and it is not in the hash table, then create a new key X and insert it inside the hash table.
